You can see the live version of my website [here](https://drewjtaylor-portfolio.netlify.app/)

I was contacted by a recruiter and asked to put together a display of my work so far, and this is my result!

A more thorough, finished portfolio page is on my to-do list, but thanks to Bootstrap, this didn't take too long to put together.

The CI/CD pipeline from a previous bootstrap project was copied here, and the Github repo is connected up to Netlify.

Long-story short, this means that every time I push changes to the main branch on Github, the project display page on Netlify updates automatically.
