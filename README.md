This is not an exhaustive list of every small project I've worked on, but it does showcase my best work and growth throughout my journey.

The CI/CD pipeline from a previous bootstrap project was copied here, and the Github repo is connected up to Netlify.

Long-story short, this means that every time I push changes to the main branch on Github, the project display page on Netlify updates automatically!

As I update old projects and complete new ones, this page will grow.
