              <p>
                Qwixxx is a dice game where players score points based off of multiple
                dice rolls. Think Yahtzee-Plus.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scoreboard was created using React, and the state is kept using Redux.
                Since Redux technically stores a NEW complete state object, as opposed to
                to updating an object, it was very easy to implement an undo/redo
                function.

      "Formed Church" is the first draft of a website created for a new church
      plant located in St. Petersburg, Florida. At this stage, I was learning
      Bootstrap, but had not yet learned much javascript, let alone React. This
      version is simply a collection of static pages with some animations and 
      a contact form.

            <h1>
                <a href="https://formation-church.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Formation Church</a>
              </h1>
              <h4>Static website updated with state management for events</h4>

              <p>
                "<em>Formation</em> Church" was one step closer to what the church founder
                visualized. Other than updating the name of the church from <em>Formed</em> Church to <em>Formation</em> Church, the
                website got an update as well!
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to trying a different visual style, this single-page-application introduced an 
                interactive element in the form of an events calendar. The form to enter 
                new events validates on the fly, and the event list displays all future events
                in date order. At this stage it uses dummy data, as it has not yet been connected to the back end.
                (Event dates were set out to 2023 on purpose so make sure they stay visible.)

              <h4>MongoDB and Express server to support endpoints for events and users</h4>

                While not the easiest to visually demonstrate, developing the back end is what resonated with me the most.
                Currently the database isn't hosted anywhere or connected to a front end, but that's on my growing list of future projects!
              </p>
              <p>In the meantime, this Express server can be tested by cloning it from github, initializing a Mongo database, and using Insomnia or Postman to hit the various endpoints.</p>
              <p>For the less savvy, instructions to get it set up are also found at the code link below.</p>
              <p>
                Full documentation for the APIs can be seen at the github link below.

                This projects display is just plain old HTML,
                although Bootstrap was used for style.

              <p>I'm currently attempting to redo a more developed portfolio site, but in the meantime this will suffice.</p>
