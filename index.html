                I completed the Nucamp coding bootcamp in 2022. The overarching project was a fictional website for a campground/exploration company called, "Nucamp"

                The front end is designed using Bootstrap and constructed using React. State management is handled by Redux. The back end is handled by an Express/NodeJS server connected to a MongoDB instance for a database. The Express server handles endpoints from the front end.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the front end app and the back end server are currently deployed and running on an EC2 server in Amazon Web Services.

              <p>
                To try out some of the functionality, try logging in as username: admin, with password: password, and selecting campsites from the directory. Campsites can then be "favorited" to keep track of for later.

                "WeeklyDire" is a fake news site (not to be confused with a fake-news site) to showcase a complete, cloud-deployed app inspired by overcoming tragedy and silver linings.
              </p>
              <p>
                My most complicated and robust project to date, Weeklydire uses MongoDB for a database, Express/Node for the server, and React for the front end (MERN). This app tracks users, articles, comments, and administrator operations through the website.
              </p>
              <p>To test out the full functionality, you can sign in with username: "testuser" and password: "testpassword", allowing you to see the "Write" and "Admin" links.</p>

      "Formed Church" is the first draft of a website created for a new church
      plant located in St. Petersburg, Florida. At this stage, I was learning
      Bootstrap, but had not yet learned much javascript, let alone React. This
      version is simply a collection of static pages with some animations and 
      a contact form.

            <h1>
                <a href="https://formation-church.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Formation Church</a>
              </h1>
              <h4>Static website updated with state management for events</h4>
              <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block border shadow-sm" src="/img/formation-church-events.jpg">
              <hr />
              <p>
                "<em>Formation</em> Church" was one step closer to what the church founder
                visualized. Other than updating the name of the church from <em>Formed</em> Church to <em>Formation</em> Church, the
                website got an update as well!
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to trying a different visual style, this single-page-application introduced an 
                interactive element in the form of an events calendar. The form to enter 
                new events validates on the fly, and the event list displays all future events
                in date order. At this stage it uses dummy data, as it has not yet been connected to the back end.
                (Event dates were set out to 3023 on purpose so make sure they stay visible.)

                While not the easiest to visually demonstrate, developing the back end is what resonated with me the most.
                Currently the database isn't hosted anywhere or connected to a front end, but that's on my growing list of future projects!
              </p>
              <p>In the meantime, this Express server can be tested by cloning it from github, initializing a Mongo database, and using Insomnia or Postman to hit the various endpoints.</p>

              <p>
                Qwixxx is a dice game where players score points based off of multiple
                dice rolls. Think Yahtzee-Plus.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scoreboard was created using React, and the state is kept using Redux.
                Since Redux technically stores a NEW complete state object, as opposed to
                to updating an object, it was very easy to implement an undo/redo
                function.
