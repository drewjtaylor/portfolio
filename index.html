                Qwixxx is a dice game where players score points based off of multiple
                dice rolls. Think Yahtzee-Plus.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scoreboard was created using React, and the state is kept using Redux.
                Since Redux technically stores a NEW complete state object, as opposed to
                to updating an object, it was very easy to implement an undo/redo
                function.

      "Formed Church" is the first draft of a website created for a new church
      plant located in St. Petersburg, Florida. At this stage, I was learning
      Bootstrap, but had not yet learned much javascript, let alone React. This
      version is simply a collection of static pages with some animations and 
      a contact form.

              <h4>Static website updated with state management for events</h4>

              <p>
                "<em>Formation</em> Church" was one step closer to what the church founder
                visualized. Other than updating the name of the church from <em>Formed</em> Church to <em>Formation</em> Church, the
                website got an update as well!
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to trying a different visual style, this version introduced an 
                interactive element in the form of an events calendar. The form to enter 
                new events validates on the fly, and the event list displays all future events
                in date order. At this stage it uses dummy data, as it has not yet been connected to the back end...

                While not the easiest to visually demonstrate, developing the back end is what resonated with me the most.
                Currently this isn't hosted anywhere and connected to a front end, but if you check back on this portfolio 
                I hope to change that shortly!
              </p>
              <p>In the meantime, this Express server can be tested by cloning it from github and using Insomnia or Postman to hit the various endpoints.</p>

                Full documentation for the APIs can be seen at the github link below.
