        >Qwixxx Scoreboard</a
      >
    </h1>
    <p>
      Qwixxx is a dice game where players score points based off of multiple
      dice rolls. Think Yahtzee-Plus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scoreboard was created using React, and the state is kept using Redux.
      Since Redux technically stores a NEW complete state object, as opposed to
      to updating an object, it was very easy to implement an undo/redo
      function.

    <h1><a href="https://formed-church.netlify.app/">Formed Church</a></h1>
    <p>
      "Formed Church" is the first draft of a website created for a new church
      plant located in St. Petersburg, Florida. At this stage, I was learning
      Bootstrap, but had not yet learned much javascript, let alone React. This
      version is simply a collection of static pages.
    </p>

    <h1>
      <a href="https://formation-church.netlify.app/">Formation Church</a>
    </h1>
    <p>
      <em>Formation</em> Church was one step closer to what the church founder
      visualized. In addition to updating the name of the church, this basic
      website got a big update as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to trying out a different style, this version introduced more
      interactive features in the form of an events calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      events: At a glance, this may look blank (depending on when I last added
      events.) If you start adding some custom events of your own, you'll
      observe the following functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Old events do not appear (which is why it may appear blank)</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Events will be displayed in order, oldest to newest.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The form validates on the fly, letting the user know the title and
          description are required.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      React-router <strong>(double-check name of package)</strong> was used to
      set up routes.
    </p>
    <p>The problem with this site is it's all front end!</p>
    <p>Cue node and mongo!</p>
